<h1>Hi, I'm Antoine! <br/>Engineering Student & Cybersecurity Adept</h1>

<p>Welcome to my profile! I'm a final-year engineering student at IMT Nord Europe, specializing in Data Science and Cybersecurity. I'm passionate about building tools that help defend and secure systems. Below are some of the projects I've been working on.</p>

<h2>👨‍💻 Cybersecurity Projects</h2>

- <b>Node.js | Express | MySQL | Security</b>
  - [<b>SQL Injection Prevention Demo</b>](https://github.com/antoineburet/sql-injection-prevention-demo)
    - A web application demonstrating a classic SQL Injection (SQLi) vulnerability.
    - Compares a vulnerable login (SQLi, plain text password storage) with a secure route using parameterized queries and `bcrypt` hashing.
    - *Highlights multiple security flaws (SQLi, plain text storage) and their correct solutions.*

- <b>Python | API | Threat Intelligence</b>
  - [<b>CISA KEV Analyzer</b>](https://github.com/antoineburet/cisa-kev-analyzer)
    - A command-line tool to query, analyze, and enrich the CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog.
    - Fetches data, provides smart caching, enriches findings with CVSS scores from the NVD API, and exports results to JSON/CSV.
    - *Originally developed as a technical challenge for a SOC/Blue Team internship interview.*
